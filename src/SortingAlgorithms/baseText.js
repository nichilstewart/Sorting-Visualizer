        Welcome to my sorting visualizer app developed using ReactJS! 
        Please select a sorting algorigthm from the list above to simulate 
        an animation for that algorithm. Below is various information about 
        the time and space complexities for the algorithm. Feel free to reach 
        out at any of the links below!
